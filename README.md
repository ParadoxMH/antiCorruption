# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

How to deploy:

1. Deploy `ManagerStorage` and `RegisterFactory`.
2. Using contact addresses from step 1, deploy `Manager`.
